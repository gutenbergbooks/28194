<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>KENNINGTON COMMON.</h3>

  <p>Before all traces be lost of Kennington Common, so soon to be
  distinguished by the euphonious epithet of <i>Park</i>, let me put a
  Query to some of your antiquarian readers in relation thereunto; and
  suffer me to make the Query a peg, whereon to hang sundry and divers
  little notes. And pray let no one ridicule the idea that Kennington has
  its antiquities; albeit that wherever you look, new buildings, new bricks
  and mortar, plaster and cement, will meet your eye; yet, does not the
  manor figure in <i>Domesday Book?</i> Is it not dignified by the stately
  name of <i>Chenintune?</i> Was it not held by Theodoric of King Edward
  the Confessor? And did it not, in times gone by, possess a royal
  residence?</p>

  <p>Here, at a Danish marriage, died Hardi Knute in 1041. Here, Harold,
  son of Earl Godwin, who seized the crown after the death of the
  Confessor, is said to have placed it on his own head. Here, in 1231, King
  Henry III. held his court, and passed a solemn and a stately Christmas.
  And here, says Matthew Paris, was held a Parliament in the succeeding
  year. Hither, says good old Stow, anno 1376, came the Duke of Lancaster
  to escape the fury of the populace of London, on Friday, February 20, the
  day following that on which Wicliffe had been brought before the bishops
  at St. Paul's. The Duke was dining "with one John of Ipres" when the news
  arrived, borne by a breathless messenger, that the people sought his
  life. When the Duke "leapt so hastily from his oysters, that he hurt both
  his legges against the foarme: wine was offered to his oysters, but hee
  would not drinke for haste; he fledde with his fellowe Syr Henry Percy,
  no man following them; and entring the Thamis, neuer stinted rowing
  vntill they came to a house neere the manor of Kenington (besides
  Lambeth), where at that time the Princesse was, with the young Prince,
  before whom hee made his complaint." Doubtless, Lambeth Marsh was then
  what its name imports. Hither also came a deputation of the chiefest
  citizens to Richard II., June 21, 1377, "before the old King was
  departed," "to accept him for their true and lawfull King and Gouernor."
  But the royal residence was destroyed before 1607. "The last of the long
  succession of royal tenants who inhabited the ancient site," says a
  writer in the <i>Illustrated London News</i> not long since (I have the
  cutting, but neglected to note the date of the paper), "was Charles I.,
  when Prince of Wales: his lodging, a house built upon a part of the site
  of the old palace, is the only existing vestige, as represented in the
  accompanying engraving (in the <i>Illus. Lond. News</i>), unless earlier
  remains are to be found in the lower parts of the interior." But I
  believe that the identity of the site of this ancient mansion (which is
  situated on the western side of Lower Kennington Lane), with part of the
  site of the old palace, is not quite so certain as the writer appears to
  intimate. In 1720, however, the manor gave the title of Earl to William
  Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, second son to George II.</p>

  <p>Kennington Common acquired an unenviable notoriety from being the
  place of execution for malefactors tried in this part of the county.
  "After the suppression of the rebellion in Scotland in 1745, many of the
  insurgents having been convicted of treason at Southwark, here suffered
  the sentence of the law" (Dugdale's <i>England and Wales</i>, p. 1015.).
  "Seventeen officers of the rebel army were hanged, drawn, and quartered"
  on this spot. (Goldsmith's <i>History</i>, continued by Morell, 4to.,
  1807, vol. ii. p. 165.)</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"One of the last executions which took place on Kennington Common was
  that of seven men; three of whom belonged to a notorious gang of
  housebreakers, eighteen in number. These men kept shops, and lived in
  credit: of the three who were executed, one made over a sum of
  2000<i>l.</i> to a friend, previous to his trial. They confessed that the
  profits of their practices, for the five years past, had been upwards of
  1500<i>l.</i> a year to each. This was in the year 1765."&mdash;From a
  cutting, sent me by a friend, from the <i>Sunday Times'</i> "Answers to
  Correspondents," March 13, 1853.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Here too occurred the Chartist meeting, on the memorable 10th of
  April, 1848.</p>

  <p>Now comes my Query. Was there ever a theatre on Kennington Common? In
  the <i>Biographia Dramatica</i> of David Erskine Baker (edit. 1782, vol.
  ii. p. 239.), we are told, that the "satyrical comical allegorical
  farce," <i>The Mock Preacher,</i> published in 8vo. in 1739, was "Acted
  to a crowded audience at Kennington Common, and many other theatres, with
  the humours of the mob." Was it acted in a booth, or in a permanent
  theatre? The words, "many other theatres," almost give one the impression
  that the latter is indicated.</p>

  <p>Many more notes might be added, but I fear lest this paper should
  already be too local to interest general readers. Suffice it to say, that
  Clayton Street, close to the Common, takes its name from the Clayton
  family; one member of which, Sir Robert Clayton, was sometime Master of
  the Drapers' Company, in whose Hall a fine portrait of him is preserved.
  Bowling Green Street derives its name from a bowling green which existed
  not very many years since. And White Hart Street from a field, which was
  so called certainly as early as 1785. On the Common was "a bridge called
  Merton Bridge, which formerly was repaired by the Canons of Merton <!--
  Page 296 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page296"></a>{296}</span>Abbey, who had lands for that purpose."
  (Lysons' <i>Environs</i>, edit. 4to., 1792, vol. i. p. 327.)</p>

  <p>It is due to your readers to state, that the authorities for the
  statements made in the former part of this paper are these: Lysons'
  <i>Environs</i>, ut supra, vol. i. pp. 325. 327.; Manning and Bray's

  <i>time</i> is that sole opportunity that God has given us for
  transacting the great business of <i>eternity</i>: that our work is
  great, and our day of working short; much of which also is lost and
  rendered useless through the cloudiness and darkness of the morning, and
  the thick vapours and unwholesome fogs of the evening; the ignorance and
  inadvertency of youth, and the disease and infirmities of old age: that
  our portion of time is not only <i>short</i> as to its duration, but also
  <i>uncertain</i> in the possession: that the loss of it is irreparable to
  the loser, and profitable to nobody else: that it shall be severely
  accounted for at the great judgment, and lamented in a sad

<h3>BATTLE OF TRAFALGAR AND DEATH OF NELSON.</h3>

  <p>The following unpublished letter, as a historical document, is worth
  preserving in the pages of "N. &amp; Q." It relates to the important
  national events of the battle of Trafalgar and death of Nelson. The
  writer was, at the time, a signal midshipman in the service, and only
  about thirteen years of age. He was a native of Glasgow, and died many
  years since, much respected.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p class="author">H.M.S. Defence,<br />At anchor off Cadiz, 28 Oct. 1805.</p>

  <p>My dear Betty [the writer's sister],</p>

  <p>I have now the pleasure of writing you, after a noble victory over the
  French and Spanish fleets, on the 21st October, off Cape Spartel. We have
  taken, burnt and sunk, gone on shore, &amp;c., twenty-one sail of the
  line. The names I will let [you] know after. On the 19[th] our frigates
  made the signal; the Combined Fleets were coming out; so as we were
  stationed between the frigate and our fleet, we repeated ditto to Lord
  Nelson. It being calm we could not make much way, but in the course of
  the night we got a strong breeze, and next morning our frigate made the
  signal for them, being all at sea. So on the afternoon of the 20[th] we
  saw them to leeward; but it was blowing fresh and very hazy, so Lord
  Nelson made our signal for a captain; so our captain went on board, and
  Lord Nelson told Captain Hope he expected he would keep sight of them all
  night. So on the morning of the 21st we observed them to leeward about
  two miles, so we made the signal to Lord Nelson how many the bearings,
  and everything; so brave Nelson bore down immediately; and at twelve
  o'clock Lord Nelson broke the south<sup>d</sup> line, and brave Admiral
  Collin[g]wood the north; and at two o'clock we were all in action. We
  were the last station'd ship; so when we went down we had two Frenchmen
  and one Spaniard on us at one time. We engag'd them forty-six minutes,
  when the "Achille" and "Polyphemus" came up to our assistance. The
  Spaniard ran away; we gave him chase, and fought him <!-- Page 298
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page298"></a>{298}</span>one hour and
  forty-six minutes, when he struck, and we boarded him, and have him safe
  at anchor, as we have not had a good wind. I am sorry to say poor Lord
  Nelson was wounded the second broadside. He went down and got his wounds
  dress'd, and he was wound'd a second time, and he just lived to hear of
  the victory. The ship we took, her name is the "San Ildifonzo,"
  eighty-two guns, and a very fine ship, new. I don't think we will save
  more than twelve sail of them: but we have sunk, burnt, drove on shore,
  twenty-one sail of the line in all; and if we had not had a gale of wind
  next day we would have taken every one of them. We were riding close in
  shore with two anchors a-head, three cables on each bower, and all our
  sails were shot to pieces, ditto our rudder and stern, and mainmast, and
  everything; but, thank good, I am here safe, though there was more shot
  at my quarters than any other part of the ship. We are now at anchor, but
  expect to go to Gibraltar every day. I hope in good you are all in
  health: I was never better in all my life. My comp<sup>ts</sup> to all
  friends [&amp;c. ...] and my dear father and mother.</p>

  <p>You must excuse this letter, as half our hands are on board our prize,

<h3>HERALDIC ANOMALY.</h3>

  <p>I beg to call the attention of the heraldic readers of "N. &amp; Q."
  to a singular custom of displaying their coats of arms, peculiar to the
  Knights of St. John, of the venerable Language of England.</p>

  <p>It is well known that the members of this valiant brotherhood,
  throughout Europe, bear their paternal shield alone, surmounted, as the
  badge of their profession, with the particular device of the order, that
  is, On a chief, gules, a cross argent. The English knights, with their
  paternal coat, bore also, party-per-pale, that of their mothers, with the
  chief of the order over both, a strange heraldic anomaly!</p>

  <p>I have somewhere read, but where, for lack of a "note," I cannot
  recollect, that in making their proofs of nobility previous to their
  admission into the order, unlike the other Languages, the cavalier of
  England gave in only the names of their father and mother, but at the
  same time it was requisite that these two names should be able to prove a
  nobility of two hundred years each.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the custom of bearing the paternal shield impaled with the
  maternal sprung from these proofs.</p>

  <p>In the British Museum, Harl. MSS. 1386., may be seen three examples of
  this custom, in a paper entitled, <i>A Note of certain Knights of
  Rhodes</i>, "in prioratû Sancti Johannis Jerusalem."</p>

  <p>1. Sir Thomas Docwra, Grand Prior of England, <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1504, a knight not more renowned as a valiant
  man-at-arms, "preux et hardi," than as a skilful diplomatist; and who, on
  the death of Fabricio Caretto, <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1520-1, was
  thought worthy to be put in competition for the Grand Mastership with the
  celebrated Villiers de L'Isle Adam, and, as Vertot tells us, only lost
  that dignity by a very trifling majority. His paternal coat&mdash;Sable,
  a cheveron engrailed argent, between three plates, on each a pale,
  gules&mdash;is impaled with that of his mother, Alice, daughter of Thomas
  Green, of Gressingham, in Yorkshire; Argent, a bugle-horn sable, stringed
  gules, between three griffins' heads, erased, of the second; over all,
  the chief of the order.</p>

  <p>2. Sir Lancelot Docwra, near kinsman to Sir Thomas, and son of Robert
  Docwra, of Docwra-Hall, in Cumberland. His arms are impaled
  with&mdash;Or, a cross flory sable&mdash;the coat armour of his mother,
  Jane, daughter of Sir John Lamplugh, of Lamplugh, in the same county; one
  "of a race," as Denton says, "of valorous gentlemen, successively for
  their worthiness knighted in the field, all, or most part of them." The
  chief of the order also surmounts his shield.</p>

  <p>3. The third is the shield of Sir John Randon; Gules, a bend checquy
  or and azure, impaling Argent, a frette, and on a chief, gules, three
  escallops of the field; over all, the chief of the order. <!-- Page 299
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page299"></a>{299}</span></p>

  <p>If any readers of "N. &amp; Q." could furnish me with more examples, I
  should be much obliged.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Three Maids.</i>&mdash;There is a spot on the road from Winchester
  to Andover called the "Three Maids." They are I believe nameless.
  Tradition says that they poisoned their father, and were for that crime
  buried alive up to their necks. Travellers passing by were ordered not to
  feed them; but one compassionate horseman as he rode along threw the core
  of an apple to one, on which she subsisted for three days. Wonderful is
  it to state that three groups of firs sprung up miraculously from the
  graves of the three maids. Thus their memories have been perpetuated. The
  peasantry of Winchester and its neighbourhood for the most part accredit
  the story, and I see no reason for disbelieving the first part of it
  myself. Does any one know of a like punishment being awarded in olden
  times, when the tender mercies of the law were cruel and arbitrary?</p>

  <p><i>Mother Russel's Post.</i>&mdash;Whilst I am on the subject of folk
  lore I may as well add, that on the road to Kings Sombourn, of
  educational renown, there is a spot where four roads meet. Report says
  that a certain Mother Russel, who committed suicide, was buried there. A
  little girl in this village was afraid to pass the spot at night on
  account of the ghosts, which are supposed to haunt it in the hours of
  darkness. The rightful name of the place is "Mother Russel's Post."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Eustace W. Jacob.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Crawley.</p>

  <p><i>Shrove Tuesday Custom</i> (Vol. ix., p. 65.).&mdash;The Shrove
  Tuesday custom mentioned by <span class="sc">Mr. Elliott</span> as
  existing at Leicester, and an account of which he quotes from Hone's
  <i>Year-Book</i>, has been abolished within the last few years. There is,
  I believe, still a curious custom on that day at Ludlow, the origin and
  meaning of which has never, so far as I am aware, been discovered and
  stated.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The corporation," I quote from a history of the town, "provide a
  rope, three inches in thickness, and in length thirty-six yards, which is
  given out at one of the windows of the Market House as the clock strikes
  four, when a large body of the inhabitants, divided into two parties,
  commence an arduous struggle, and as soon as either party gains the
  victory by pulling the rope beyond the prescribed limits, the pulling
  ceases, &amp;c.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Without doubt this singular custom is symbolical of some remarkable
  event, and a remnant of that ancient language of visible signs, which,
  says a celebrated writer, 'imperfectly supplies the want of letters to
  perpetuate the remembrance of public or private transactions.' The sign
  in this instance has survived the remembrance of the occurrence it was
  designed to represent, and remains a profound mystery. It has been
  insinuated that the real occasion of this custom is known to the
  corporation, but that, for some reason or other, they are tenacious of
  the secret."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The local historian then mentions an "obscure tradition," but as it is
  not in agreement with my own opinion, I omit it.</p>

<h3>STORNELLO.</h3>

  <p>Verses, the rhymes of which return after the fashion of those printed
  in "N. &amp; Q." (Vol. vi., p. 603., and Vol. vii., p. 174.), are
  commonly current among the peasants of Tuscany, and in many instances
  form the materials of their popular songs. It is probable that this
  description of rhyme originated in the "bel paese la dove 'l si suona."
  They usually turn on a combination of <i>three</i> words, as in those
  quoted in Vol vii. of "N. &amp; Q." And the name <i>stornello</i>, as
  will be readily perceived, is derived from <i>tornare</i>, to return. I
  send you a specimen of one of them, which has a certain degree of
  historical interest attached to it, from its connexion with the movement
  of 1848. It was difficult to walk through the streets of Florence in
  those days without hearing it carolled forth by more than one Florentine
  Tyrtæus. <i>Now</i>, I need hardly say, "we never mention it&mdash;its
  name is never heard." The patriot-flag was a <i>tricolor</i> of white,
  red, and green, a nosegay of which colours a youth has brought to his
  mistress. She sings as follows:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"E gli dirò che il verde, il rosso, il bianco</p>
      <p>Gli stanno ben con una spada al fianco.</p>
      <p>E gli dirò che il bianco, il verde, il rosso,</p>
      <p>Vuol dir che Italia il duro giogo ha scosso.</p>
      <p>E gli dirò che il rosso, il bianco, il verde</p>
      <p>E un terno che si giuoca e non si perde."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Of which the following rough version may serve to give a
  sufficiently-accurate idea of the meaning, for the benefit of your
  "country gentlemen" readers:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And I'll tell him the green, and the red, and the white</p>
      <p>Would look well by his side as a sword-knot so bright.</p>
      <p>And I'll tell him the white, and the green, and the red</p>
      <p>Mean, our country has flung the vile yoke from her head.</p>
      <p>And I'll tell him the red, and the white, and the green</p>
      <p>Is the prize that we play for, a prize that we'll win."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"Un terno che si giuoca" is a phrase which refers to the system of the
  public lotteries, <!-- Page 300 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page300"></a>{300}</span>established (so much to their shame) by
  the Italian governments; and a page of explanation of that system would
  be needful, to make any literal translation of it intelligible to an
  English reader.</p>

  <p>In conclusion I may say, in reply to the Query of <span
  class="sc">Henry H. Breen</span>, that the Popes alluded to in the
  epigram cited by him as above referred to (Vol. vi., p. 603.), seem
  evidently to have been Julius II. (Rovere), Leo X. (Medici), Clement VII.
  (Medici), and Paul III. (Farnese). And the epigram in question says no
  more than the truth, in asserting that they all four occasioned infinite
  mischief to France.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Perspective.</i>&mdash;There is a very common error in drawing
  walls, the plane of which is parallel to the plane of the picture. An
  instance of it occurs in the façade of Sennacherib's Palace, Layard's 2nd
  book on Nineveh, frontispiece. All the horizontal lines in the plane of
  the picture are drawn parallel. The fact is, that every line above or
  below the line of the horizon, though <i>really</i> parallel to it,
  <i>apparently</i> approaches it, as it is produced to the right or left.
  The reason is obvious. One point in the wall, viz. that on which you let
  fall a perpendicular from your eye, is nearest to your eye. The
  perpendicular height of the wall, as drawn through this point, must
  therefore appear greater than as drawn through any other point more to
  the right or left. The lines which are really parallel do therefore
  apparently converge on some point more or less distant, according to the
  distance of the wall from your eye. Every drawing in which this principle
  is not considered must, I think, appear out of perspective.</p>

  <p class="address">Tandridge.</p>

  <p>"<i>That.</i>"&mdash;I lately met with the following grammatical
  puzzle among some old papers. I forget from what book I copied it many
  years ago. Perhaps it may be new to some of your readers.</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p><i>Corporation Enactments.</i>&mdash;In the town books of the
  Corporation of Youghal, co. Cork, among other singular enactments of that
  body are two which will now be regarded as curiosities. In the years 1680
  and 1703, a cook and a barber received their freedom, on condition that
  they would respectively dress the mayor's feasts, and shave the
  Corporation, gratis!</p>

  <p><i>Jacobite Club.</i>&mdash;The adherents of the Stuarts are now
  nearly extinct; but I recollect a few years ago an old gentleman, in
  London, who was then upwards of eighty years of age, and who was a stanch
  Jacobite. I have heard him say that, "when he was a young man, his father
  belonged to a society in Aldersgate Street, called the 'Mourning Bush;'
  and this Bush was to be always in mourning until the Stuarts were
  restored." A member of this Society having been met in mourning when one
  of the reigning family had died, was asked by one of the members how it
  so happened? His reply was, that he was "not mourning for the dead, but
  for the living." The old gentleman was father of the Mercers' Company,
  and his brother of the Stationers' Company: they were bachelors, and
  citizens of the old school, hospitable, liberal, and charitable. An
  instance occurred, that the latter had a presentation to Christ's
  Hospital: he was applied to on behalf of a person who had a large family;
  but the father not being a freeman, he could not present it to the son.
  He immediately bought the freedom for the father, and gave the son the
  presentation! This is a rare act.</p>

  <p>The brothers have long gone to receive the reward of their goodness,
  and lie buried in the cemetery attached to Mercers' Hall, Cheapside.</p>

  <p><i>Dean Nowell's first Wife.</i>&mdash;Churton, in his <i>Life of
  Alexander Nowell</i>, dean of St. Paul's, p. 368., is at a loss to know
  the name of the dean's first wife. He says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Of his first wife nothing farther is known but that he was married,
  either to her or to his second wife, in or before the year 1561. His
  surviving wife, Eliz. Nowell, had been twice married before, and had
  children by both her former husbands. Laurence Ball appears to have been
  her first husband, and Thomas Blount her second."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The pedigree of Bowyer, in the <i>Visitation of Sussex</i>, in 1633-4,
  gives the name of the dean's first wife:</p>

<h3>SIR EDMUND PLOWDEN.</h3>

  <p>In your publication (Vol. iv., p. 319.), one of your correspondents
  has given some interesting particulars relative to Sir Edmund Plowden,
  New Albion, &amp;c., and expresses the hope that Americans will hereafter
  do justice to the memory of one really deserving their respect. I am
  desirous of doing something to vindicate his memory and claims; and to
  this end should be greatly obliged if your correspondent would favour me
  with some additional facts. To get at these, I will put some of them in
  the interrogative form.</p>

  <p>When and where was Sir Edmund born?</p>

  <p>What is the evidence that he was in America from 1620 to 1630? If so,
  where (in what localities), and what capacity?</p>

  <p>He says that his sister married a son of Secretary Lake, <i>then</i>
  in office; but Lake was turned out several years before 1630, and Lord
  Baltimore took his place, I think. Nor was Wentworth made Earl of
  Strafford till after the time of the petition.</p>

  <p>He is said to have served five years in Ireland: in what capacity?</p>

  <p>Who were Viscount Musherry, Lord Monson, Sir Thomas Denby, (Claiborne
  I know of), Capt. Balls; besides Sir John Laurence, Sir Bowyer <!-- Page
  302 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page302"></a>{302}</span>Worstley,
  Barrett, &amp;c.? Where did these parties "die, in America," in 1634?</p>

  <p>Is the <i>Latin</i> original of the character in existence? There is
  an omission in the bounds given in the paper referred to: can I get an
  extract from the original entry of limits?</p>

  <p>Did the charter ever pass the <i>Great Seal</i>?</p>

  <p>Would it be valid, if only passed under the private seal?</p>

  <p>Can the date of the grant to Danby be ascertained?</p>

  <p>Are there any memoranda of Plowden's six years' residence as Governor
  of New Albion (I have some of his residence in Virginia)?</p>

  <p>Can I get more definite facts about the misconduct of Francis?</p>

  <p>The license for alienation, &amp;c. is stated to have been obtained
  15th of Charles, 1646; but the 15th of Charles was 1640. When did he
  arrive to attend to his property, and when was he imprisoned in the
  Fleet?</p>

  <p>Who was Beauchamp Plantagenet, the author of the tract on <i>New
  Albion</i>, published in 1648?</p>

  <p>Who were Robert Evelin, Captain Young, and Master Miles, mentioned in
  that tract?</p>

  <p>Can you give me any additional facts, <i>dates</i> especially, of
  events and births, deaths, &amp;c.?</p>

  <p>I know not into whose hands these Queries will come; but I can say
  that, if they are answered, the cause of historic truth and justice will
  be served; and I shall have the aid I want towards correcting the
  misrepresentations and errors that have been accumulating for years on
  this point.</p>

<h3>ANCIENT CLOCK, AND ODEVAERE'S HISTORY OF IT.</h3>

  <p>As a portion of the history of the magnificent clock, which came into
  my possession last year, is connected with Holland, I think it probable
  that I may, through the means of "N. &amp; Q." and the <i>Navorscher</i>,
  be able to obtain the information respecting it which I desire. I shall
  therefore be very much obliged if you will give this communication a
  place.</p>

  <p>It will be necessary to give a brief description of the clock, so as
  to enable parties on the other side of the water to recognise and
  identify it. The clock, which is of copper richly gilt, and elaborately
  engraved, stands about four feet high, independent of the pedestal. It is
  of architectural design, and is divided into three stories, having
  detached columns at each corner. The two lower stories contain the dials
  in the front. The upper story exhibits the groups of moving silver
  figures, which strike the quarters, hours, and move in procession whilst
  a tune is played by a chime of bells. The whole is surmounted by a dome,
  on which is placed a silver cock, which flaps his wings and crows when
  the clock strikes. It was made by Isaac Hahrecht (the artist who made the
  great clock in the cathedral at Strasburg), according to the inscription
  on it, in the year 1589: and is evidently a model of that celebrated work
  condensed into a single tower, since it performs all the feats of that
  clock. Its reputed history, as given in a printed account of it, is, that
  it was made for Pope Sixtus V., and was for more than two hundred years
  in the possession of the Court of Rome. It afterwards came into the
  possession of William I., King of the Netherlands, who authorised
  Odevaere the antiquary, now deceased, to investigate everything
  concerning it, and to give a description of it. What I should wish to
  know is, who was this Odevaere, and where is his description of it to be
  found? With regard to the history of the clock, I should wish to know the
  authority for the statement of its having been made for the Pope, when
  and how it came to leave the Vatican; how it became the property of the
  King of Holland; when and why it ceased to belong to the crown of
  Holland; and under what circumstances it came over to this country, where
  it was exhibited in 1850?</p>

  <p>If any of the readers of "N. &amp; Q.," or the <i>Navorscher</i>, can
  give me any information respecting it, I shall feel greatly obliged.</p>

  occurred.</p>

  <p>The expedition of Sir John Richardson to the Arctic shores, which
  suggests the above Query, also gives rise to another. Did any of your
  readers ever amuse themselves, as children, by performing the dance known
  as <i>kutchin kutchu</i>-ing; which consists in jumping about with the
  legs bent in a sitting posture? If so, have they not been struck with a
  philological mania, on seeing his picture of the Kutchin-Kutcha Indians
  dancing; in which the principal performer is actually figuring in the

  something more than a mere coincidence?</p>

  believe, is the wine-bottle, in its present shape, to be seen. On the
  other hand, I have never found any person able to remember the use of
  flasks, or indeed any other than the wine-bottle in its present shape.
  The change must have been rapidly effected between 1760 and 1790. Of
  course I am aware that certain wines, Greek, I believe, are still
  imported in flasks.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries with Answers.</h2>

  <p><i>Postmaster at Merton College.</i>&mdash;Can you tell me whether
  there is any known derivation for the term "Postmaster," as applied to
  part of the members on the Foundation of Merton College, Oxford? Also,
  What connexion there is between this word and the Latin for it, which is

  <p class="author">J. G. T.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[It seems probable that these postmasters formerly occupied one of the
  postern gates of the college. Hence we find Anthony à Wood, in his Life,
  August 1, 1635, says, "A fine of 30<i>li.</i> was set by the warden and
  fellowes of Merton College. When his father renewed his lease of the old
  stone-house, wherein his son A. Wood was borne (called antiently
  Portionists' or Postmasters' Hall), for forty yeares," &amp;c. Again,
  April 13, 1664: "A meeting of the warden and fellowes of Merton College,
  where the renewing of the leases belonging to the family, concerning the
  housing (Portionists' Hall and its appurtenances) against Merton College,
  was by them proposed." Fuller, in his <i>Church Hist.</i>, book <span
  class="scac">III</span>. cent. xiii. sect. 8., has given the origin of
  postmasters. "There is," says he, "a by-foundation in Merton College, a
  kind of college in the college, and this tradition goeth of their
  original:&mdash;Anciently there was, over against Merton College, a small
  unendowed hall, whose scholars had so run in arrears, that their opposite
  neighbours, out of charity, took them into their college (then but nine
  in number) to wait on the fellows. But since, they are freed from any
  attendance, and endowed with plentiful maintenance.... Bishop Jewel was a
  postmaster, before removed hence to be fellow of Corpus Christi." Consult
  also Oxoniana, vol. ii. pp. 15-22. The <i>Portionistæ</i>, or
  Postmasters, did not reside in the college till the latter end of the
  reign of Queen Elizabeth, but in a hall opposite to it, which had been
  provided for the use of the college by Peter de Habinton, or Habendon,
  the first warden. It afterwards became the property of the father of
  Anthony à Wood, and beneath its roof that distinguished antiquary was
  born, December 17, 1632. The second brother of Anthony became one of the
  postmasters of Merton College.]</p>

  engaged in an adventure which gave rise to the well-known ballad of 'The

<h3>BRYDONE THE TOURIST.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., pp. 138. 255.)</p>

  <p>In reply to H. R. <span class="scac">NÉE</span> F., I beg to state
  that the writer of the remarks alluded to, on Brydone's <i>Tour in Sicily
  and Malta</i>, was the Rev. Robert Finch, M.A., formerly of Balliol
  College in this University, and who died about the year 1830. When I met
  with Mr. Finch's honest and somewhat blunt expression of opinion,
  recorded in a <!-- Page 306 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page306"></a>{306}</span>copy which once belonged to him, of
  Brydone's <i>Tour</i>, I was quite ignorant of the hostile criticisms
  that had appeared at different times on that once popular work; but
  knowing Mr. Finch's high character for scholarship, and a knowledge of
  Italy, I thought his remark worth sending to a publication intended, like
  "N. &amp; Q.," as "A Medium of Intercommunication for Literary Men,
  Antiquaries," &amp;c., who are well able to examine a Note of the kind;
  and either to accept it as valid, or to reject it as untenable. On
  referring now to some standard works, in order to discover the opinions
  of learned men respecting Mr. Brydone's <i>Tour</i>, the first work I
  looked into was the <i>Biographie Universelle</i> (in eighty-three
  volumes, and not yet completed, Paris, 1811-1853), in vol. lix. of which
  the following observations occur, under the name of <span
  class="sc">Brydone</span> (Patrice):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On lui a reproché d'avoir sacrifié la vérité au plaisir de raconter
  des choses piquantes. On l'avait accusé aussi d'avoir, par son
  indiscretion, suscité à l'Abbé Recupero, Chanoine de Catane, une
  persécution de la part de son évêque. Cette indiscretion n'eut pas
  heureusement un résultat aussi facheux; mais ses erreurs sur plusieurs
  points sont évidentes; il donne 4000 toises de hauteur à l'Etna qui n'en
  a que 1662; il commet d'autres fautes qui ont été relevées par les
  voyageurs venus après lui. Bartels (<i>Briefe über Kalabrien und
  Sicilien</i>, 2te Auflage, 3 Bd., 8vo., Götting. 1791-92) est même
  persuadé que le voyage au sommet de l'Etna, chef-d'&oelig;uvre de
  narration, n'est qu'un roman, et cet avis est partagé par d'autres."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Göthe says (<i>Werke</i>, Band xxviii. pp. 189, 190.: Stuttgart, 1830)
  that when he inquired at Catania respecting the best method of ascending
  Mount Etna, Chevalier Gioeni, the professor of natural history there,
  gave him the following advice and information:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Als wir den Ritter um die Mittel befragten wie man sich benehmen
  müsse um den Aetna zu besteigen, wollte er von einer Wagniss nach dem
  Gipfel, besonders in der gegenwärtigen Jahreszeit gar nichts hören.
  Ueberhaupt, sagte er, nachdem er uns um Verzeihung gebeten, die hier
  ankommenden Fremden sehen die Sache für allzuleicht an; wir andern
  Nachbarn des Berges sind schon zufrieden, wenn wir ein paarmal in unserm
  Leben die beste Gelegenheit abgepasst und den Gipfel erreicht haben.
  Brydone, der zuerst durch seine Beschreibung die Lust nach diesem
  Feuergipfel entzündet, ist gar nicht hinauf gekommen."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From these quotations it is evident, that Mr. Finch was not singular
  in the belief he entertained; and certainly the scepticism of men so
  eminent as Professor Gioeni, Dr. Barthels, and Messrs. Eyriès and Parisot
  (the French writers whose names are attached to the Memoir in the
  <i>Biog. Univ.</i>), must be grounded on reasons deserving of attention.
  An ordinary reader of Brydone would accept the account of his ascent with
  implicit confidence; but when veteran professors, scientific men, and
  experienced travellers and scholars refuse to believe that he reached the
  summit of Etna, the most probable mode of accounting for their
  incredulity is, perhaps to suppose, that in their opinion he had mistaken
  some other part of the mountain for the real summit. Not having met with
  any detail of their reasons for disbelief, I am only able to state their
  bare assertion. In my opinion, the beautifully glowing and poetical
  description of the magic scene beheld by Brydone from the
  mountain&mdash;a description, the perusal of which, in youth, remains for
  ever after imprinted on the memory, like a passage from Addison or
  Gibbon, could only have been written by an actual spectator.</p>

<h3>"THE RED COW"&mdash;CROMWELL'S CARRIAGES, ETC.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 87.)</p>

  <p>I have known "The Red Cow," at the top of Granham Hill, near
  Marlborough, for fifty years, but do not recollect ever to have heard of
  any particular origin for the sign.</p>

  <p>The old carriages at Manton were built about a century and a half ago,
  perhaps not so much, for one of the Baskerville family, on the occasion
  of his being sheriff of the county to which he belonged, probably Wilts
  or Hereford. There are two of them: one a square coach, and the other a
  very high phaeton. The Baskerville arms&mdash;Ar. a chevron gu. between
  three hurts, impaling, quarterly, one and four, or, a cross moline az,
  two and three, gu. a chevron ar. between three mallets or&mdash;are
  painted on the panels. As I have no ordinary of arms at hand, I cannot
  ascribe this impalement; but will trust to some more learned herald among
  your correspondents to determine who the lady was? When her name, perhaps
  Moleyns or Molyneaux, is ascertained, reference to a Baskerville pedigree
  would probably determine the husband, and the precise date of the
  carriages, which could not have belonged to the Protector.</p>

  <p>O. Cromwell's arms were, Sable, a lion rampant ar. There were also two
  families styled Williams <i>alias</i> Cromwell: one of which bore, Gu.
  three cheverons ar. between as many lions rampant or; the other, Sa. a
  lion rampant ar., the same as Oliver's coat, and probably derived by him
  from the Williams family.</p>

  <p>I have wandered from "The Red Cow," but I will not omit to hazard an
  idea for the consideration of <span class="sc">Glywysydd</span>.
  Marlborough has changed its armorial bearings several times; but the
  present coat, containing a white bull, was granted by Harvey, Clarenceux
  in <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1565. Cromwell was attached to
  Cowbridge and its cow by family <!-- Page 307 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page307"></a>{307}</span>descent; so he was to Marlborough by
  congeniality of sentiment with the burghers. Query, Whether, in affection
  to the latter, he granted to the town a new coat, some such as the
  following: Gules, a bull passant argent, armed or, impaling a cow passant
  regardant gules: and so might originate "The Red Cow" upon Granham Hill.
  History is entirely silent upon this point; but if such a combination
  were ever given to Marlborough, it is quite certain that Harvey's grant
  was resumed at the Restoration. I have quite forgotten to remark, that
  there is a suburb at Marlborough called Cowbridge&mdash;a fact which
  seems to strengthen my hypothesis.</p>

  <p>A cow may be borne by some name, but at present I only recollect that
  of Vach: to which is accorded, Ar. three cows' heads erased sable. Bulls
  and oxen occur frequently; as in Fitz-Geffrey, Cowley, Bull, Oxley,
  Oxcliffe, Oxendon, &amp;c. Bulls' heads belong to the families of
  Bullock, Hillesdon, Fleming, Barbor, Frend, Gornay, Bullman, and
  Williams, a baronet, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>FOX-HUNTING.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 172.)</p>

  <p>As no answer to the Query on "Fox-hunting" has yet appeared in "N.
  &amp; Q.," I venture to send the following extracts from an article in
  the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, March 1832, on "The Management of Hounds and
  Horses," by Nimrod. It appears that "the first public notice of
  fox-hunting" occurs in the reign of Richard II., who gave permission to
  the Abbot of Peterborough to hunt the fox:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In Twice's <i>Treatise on the Craft of Hunting</i>, Reynard is thus
  classed:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'And for to sette young hunterys in the way</p>
      <p class="i1">To venery, I cast me fyrst to go;</p>
      <p>Of which four bestes be, that is to say,</p>
      <p class="i1">The Hare, the Herte, the Wulf, and the wild Boar:</p>
      <p>But there ben other bestes, five of the chase,</p>
      <p class="i1">The Buck the first, the seconde is the Do;</p>
      <p>The <i>Fox</i> the third, which hath hard grace,</p>
      <p class="i1">The ferthe the Martyn, and the last the Roe.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"It is indeed quite apparent, that until at most a hundred and fifty
  years ago, the fox was considered as an inferior animal of the chase; the
  stag, buck, and even hare, ranking before him. Previously to that period,
  he was generally taken in nets or hays, set on the outside of his earth:
  when he <i>was</i> hunted, it was among rocks and crags, or woods
  inaccessible to horseman: such a scene in short, or nearly so, as we have
  drawn to the life in Dandie Dinmont's primitive <i>chasse</i> in <i>Guy
  Mannering</i>. It is difficult to determine when the first regularly
  appointed pack of hounds appeared among us. Dan Chaucer gives the thing
  in <i>embryo</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Aha, the fox! and after him they ran;</p>
      <p>And eke with staves many another man.</p>
      <p>Ran Coll our dogge, and Talbot, and Gerlond,</p>
      <p>And Malkin with her distaff in her hond.</p>
      <p>Ran cow and calf, and eke the very hogges,</p>
      <p>So fered were for the barking of the dogges,</p>
      <p>And shouting of the men and women eke,</p>
      <p>They ronnen so, hem thought her hertes brake.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"At the next stage, no doubt, neighbouring farmers kept one or two
  hounds each; and, on stated days, met for the purpose of destroying a fox
  that had been doing damage to their poultry yards. By and bye, a few
  couple of strong hounds seem to have been kept by the small country
  esquires or yeomen who could afford the expense, and they joined packs.
  Such were called <i>trencher</i> hounds, implying that they ran loose
  about the house, and were not confined in kennel."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>These are but short extracts, but they comprise the whole of what is
  said on the first origin of fox-hunting. The rest of the article treats
  of the quality and breed of horses and hounds.</p>

<h3>WEATHER RULES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 50. 535.)</p>

  <p><i>St. Vincent's Day, Jan. 22.</i>&mdash;In Brand's <i>Popular
  Antiquities</i>, Bohn's edition, vol. i. p. 38., is to be found the
  following notice of this day:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Mr. Douce's manuscript notes say: 'Vincenti festo si Sol radiet,
  memor esto;' thus Englished by Abraham Fleming:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Remember on St Vincent's Day,</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"[Dr. Foster is at a loss to account for the origin of this command,
  &amp;c.]"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is probable that the concluding part of the precept has been lost;
  but a curious old manuscript, which fell into my hands some years since,
  seems to supply the deficiency. The manuscript in question is a sort of
  household book, kept by a family of small landed proprietors in the
  island of Guernsey between the years 1505 and 1569. It contains
  memoranda, copies of wills, settlements of accounts, recipes, scraps of
  songs and parts of hymns and prayers; some Romanist, some Anglican, some
  of the Reformed Church in France. Among the scraps of poetry I find the
  following rhymes on St. Vincent's Day; the first three lines of which are
  evidently a translation of the Latin verse above quoted, the last
  containing the to be remembered:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Prens garde au jour St. Vincent,</p>
      <p>Car sy ce jour tu vois et sent</p>
      <p>Que le soleil soiet cler et biau,</p>
      <p>Nous érons du vin plus que d'eau."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>These lines follow immediately after the rhymed prognostications to be
  drawn from the state of the weather on St. Paul's Day, Jan. 28. As these
  <!-- Page 308 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page308"></a>{308}</span>verses differ from those quoted in Brand,
  from an <i>Almanack</i> printed at Basle in 1672, I here give the
  Guernsey copy:</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p>Qui te vauldra d'or ugne myne;</p>

  lines on St. Vincent's Day.</p>

  <p>I beg to send to your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. Richard
  Bingham</span> the following replies to his seven Queries.</p>

  <p>1. If there be any use in verifying so slight a verbal reference to
  Panormitan, one of whose huge folios, Venet. 1473, I have examined in
  vain, perhaps the object might be attained by the assistance of such a
  book as Thomassin's <i>Vetus et Nova Ecclesiæ Disciplina</i>, in the
  chapter "De Episcopis Titularibus," tom. i.</p>

  <p>2. Bishop Bale's description of the monks of Bangor is to be found in
  his <i>Scriptor. Britann. Catal.</i> Compare Richard Broughton's <i>True
  Memorial of the ancient State of Great Britain</i>, pp. 39. 40, ed. an.
  1650.</p>

  <p>3. I should think in his <i>Colloquies</i>, and most probably in the
  <i>Peregrinatio Religionis ergo</i>. Erasmus, in his <i>Modus orandi
  Deum</i>, also observes that "quidam in concionibus implorant opem
  Virginis," and condemns the "vestigia veteris Paganismi." (sigg. <i>u</i>
  and <i>s</i> 2, Basil, 1551.)</p>

  <p>4. Respecting the existence of what is called the Epistle of St.
  Athanasius to Eustathius, Cardinal Bona was right and Bingham in error.
  Vide St. Athan., <i>Opp.</i> ii. 560, ed. Bened.</p>

  <p>5. Bingham was seriously astray in consequence of his misunderstanding
  Bona, who does not by any means refer to Pamelius, but to the anonymous
  author of the <i>Antiquitatum Liturgicarum Syntagma</i>, who is believed
  to have been Florentius Vanderhaer. If Pamelius is to be introduced at
  all, the reference in Bingham should be, not to "tom. iii. p. 307.," but
  to i. 328-30. I would remark too that, in the heading of one of the
  extracts subjoined, "ex Vita Ambrosiana," should be "ex Ritu
  Ambrosiano."</p>

  <p>6. Joannes Semeca did not flourish <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  1250, but died in 1243. Suicer wrongly refers to "Dist. IV. cap. iv.,"
  and Harding, more inaccurately, to "Dist. IV. <i>can.</i> iv." (Bp.
  Jewel's <i>Works</i>, <!-- Page 309 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page309"></a>{309}</span>ed. Jelf, i. 419.) Cap. xxviii. is the one
  intended, and there is no corruption whatsoever.</p>

  <p>7. Joseph Bingham was only closely following Barrow. The first edition
  of De la Bigne's <i>Bibliotheca Patrum</i>, tom. i., also has the
  evidently senseless reading, "ista quidam <i>ego</i>," instead of
  "<i>nego</i>," about which see Comber's <i>Roman Forgeries</i>, ii. 187.
  For MSS. of the Epistles of Pope Symmachus, your correspondent may
  consult the Carmelite Lud. Jacob à S. Carolo's <i>Bibliotheca
  Pontifica</i>, p. 216.; or, much more successfully, De Montfaucon's
  <i>Bibliotheca Bibliothecarum Manuscriptorum</i>, Paris, 1739.</p>

  <p class="author">R. G.</p>

  <p>Should <span class="sc">Mr. Richard Bingham</span> not yet have
  verified the reference to Erasmus, I beg to furnish him with the means of
  doing so but I am tolerably certain that I recollect having met with
  another place in which this admirable writer more fully censures those
  preachers of his Church who, at the commencement of their sermons, called
  upon the Virgin Mary for assistance, in a manner somewhat similar to that
  in which heathen poets used to invoke the Muses. The following passage,
  however, may be quite sufficient for your correspondent's purpose:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sed si est fons gratiæ, quid opus est illi dicere Ora pro nobis? Non
  est probabile eam consuetudinem à gravibus viris inductam, sed ab inepto
  quopiam, qui, quòd didicerat apud Poëtas propositioni succedere
  invocationem, pro Musa supposuit Mariam."&mdash;Des. Erasmi Roterod.

<h3>ANCIENT TENURE OF LANDS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 173.)</p>

  <p>About the close of the tenth century (and perhaps much earlier) there
  began to arise two distinct modes of holding or possessing land: the one
  a <i>feud</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a stipendiary estate; the other
  <i>allodium</i>, the phrase applied to that species of property which had
  become vested by allotment in the conquerors of the country. The
  stipendiary held of a superior; the allodialist of no one, but enjoyed
  his land as free and independent property. The interest of the
  stipendiary did not originally extend beyond his own life, but in course
  of time it acquired an hereditary character which led to the practice of
  subinfeudation; for the stipendiary or feudatory, considering himself as
  substantially the owner, began to imitate the example of his lord by
  carving out portions of the feud to be held of himself by some other
  person, on the terms and conditions similar to those of the original
  grant. Here B. must be looked upon as only vassal to A., his superior or
  lord; and although feuds did not originally extend beyond the life of the
  first vassal, yet in process of time they were extended to his heirs, so
  that when the feudatory died, his male descendants were admitted to the
  succession, and in default of them, then such of his male collateral
  kindred as were of the blood of the first feudatory, but no others;
  therefore, in default of these, it would consequently revert to A., who
  had a reversionary interest in the feud capable of taking effect as soon
  as B.'s interest should determine. If the subinfeudatory lord alienated,
  it would operate as a forfeiture to the person in immediate
  reversion.</p>

  <p class="author">W. T. T.</p>

  <p>As a very brief reply to the queries of J.&nbsp;B., permit me to make the
  following observations.</p>

  <p>The Queen is lady paramount of all the lands in England; every estate
  in land being holden, immediately or mediately, of the crown. This
  doctrine was settled shortly after the Norman Conquest, and is still an
  axiom of law.</p>

  <p>Until the statute <i>Quia Emptores</i>, 18 Edw. I., a tenant in fee
  simple might grant lands to be holden by the grantee and his heirs <i>of
  the grantor and his heirs</i>, subject to feudal services and to escheat;
  and by such subinfeudation manors were created.</p>

  <p>The above-named statute forbade the future subinfeudation of lands,
  and consequently hindered the further creation of manors. Since the
  statute a seller of the fee can but transfer his tenure. There are
  instances in which one manor is holden of another, both having been
  created before the statute.</p>

  <p>In the instance mentioned by J.&nbsp;B. it is presumed that the hamlet
  escheated to the heirs of A. on failure of the heirs of B. (See the
  statute <i>De Donis Conditionalibus</i>, 13 Edw. I.)</p>

  <p>It is not, and never was, necessary, or even possible, that the lord
  of a manor should be the owner of all the lands therein; on the contrary,
  if he were, there would be no manor; for a manor cannot subsist without a
  court baron, and there can be no such court unless there are
  <i>freehold</i> tenants (at least two in number) holding of the lord. The
  land retained by the lord consists of his own demesne and the wastes,
  which last comprise the highways and commons. If the lord should alienate
  all the lands, but retain his lordship, the latter becomes a <i>seignory
  in gross</i>.</p>

  <p>Such was and is the tenure of lands in England, so far as concerns the
  queries of J.&nbsp;B. He will find the subject lucidly explained at great
  length in the second volume of Blackstone's <i>Commentaries</i>.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">I. Ctus.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Lincoln's Inn.</p>

  <p>I think that J.&nbsp;B. will find in Blackstone, or any elementary book on
  the law of real property, all the information which he requires. The case
  which he puts was, I suppose, the common case <!-- Page 310 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page310"></a>{310}</span>of subinfeudation
  before the statute of <i>Quia Emptores</i>, 18 Edw. I. A., the feoffor,
  reserved to himself no estate or reversion in the land, but the seignory
  only, with the rent and services, by virtue of which he might again
  become entitled to the land by escheat, as for want of heirs of the
  feoffee, or by forfeiture, as for felony. If the feoffment were in tail,
  the land would then, as now, revert on failure of issue, unless the
  entail had been previously barred. The right of alienation was gradually
  acquired; the above statute of <i>Quia Emptores</i> was the most
  important enactment in that behalf. With this exception, and the right to
  devise and to bar entails, the lords of manors have the same interest in
  the land held by freeholders of the manor that they had in times of
  subinfeudation. (Blackstone's <i>Comm.</i>, vol. ii. ch. 287., may be
  carefully consulted.)</p>

<h2>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h2>

  <p><i>Spots on Collodion Pictures, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;The principal
  difficulty I experience in the collodion process is occasioned by the
  appearance of numberless very minute spots or points over the whole
  extent of the picture. These occurring on the whites of my pictures
  (positives) give them a rough, rubbed, appearance and want of
  <i>density</i>, which I should feel obliged if any of your correspondents
  can teach me how to overcome.</p>

  <p>One of your photographic querists inquires the remedy for his calotype
  negatives darkening all over before the minor details are brought out. I
  had for a long time been troubled in the same way, but by diminishing the
  aperture of my three-inch lens to half an inch, and reducing the strength
  of my sensitising solution to that given by <span class="sc">Dr.
  Diamond</span>, and, in addition, by developing with gallic acid alone
  until the picture became tolerably distinct in all its parts, and then
  applying the gallo-nitrate, I have quite succeeded in obtaining
  first-rate negatives. It is well to prepare only a small quantity of
  aceto-nitrate at once, as the acetic acid is of a sufficiently volatile
  nature to escape from the solution, which is a not unfrequent cause of
  the general darkening of the picture. It would be well to substitute a
  more fixed acid for the acetic if this be practicable, as it is in the
  collodion process, where tartaric is recommended.</p>

  <p><i>The Double Iodide Solution.</i>&mdash;The great difference in the
  quantity of iodide of potassium ordered by different persons, to dissolve
  a given weight of iodide of silver in a given volume of water, has
  induced me to make some experiments on the subject. I find that using
  pure nitrate of silver, and perfectly pure iodide of potassium (part of a
  parcel for which Mr. Arnold, who manufactures iodine on a large scale in
  this island, got a medal at the Exhibition of 1851), the quantity of
  iodide of potassium required varies, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, to the
  extent of 15 per cent., with the quantity of water added to the iodide of
  silver before adding the iodide of potassium; the minimum required being
  when the two salts act on each other in as dry a form as possible. Take
  the precipitate of iodide of silver, got by decomposing 100 grains of
  nitrate of silver with 97.66 grains of iodide of potassium; drain off the
  last water completely, so that the precipitate occupies not more than
  five or six drachms by measure; throw on it 640 grains of iodide of
  potassium; rapid solution ensues; when perfectly clear, add water up to
  four ounces: the solution remains unclouded. But if two or three ounces
  of water had been first poured on the iodide of silver, 680 grains, as I
  stated in my former paper, would have been required, and perhaps 734. The
  <i>rationale</i> is, I suppose, that in a concentrated form the salts act
  on each other with greater energy, and a smaller quantity of the solvent
  is required than if it is diluted. Many analogous cases occur in
  chemistry. I hope this little experiment will be useful to others, as a
  saving of 15 per cent. on the iodide of potassium is gained. As a large
  body of precipitated iodide of silver can be more completely drained than
  a smaller quantity, in practice it will be found that small precipitates
  require a few grains more than I have stated: thus, throw on the
  precipitate of iodide of silver (got from 150 grains of nitrate), drained
  dry, 960 grains of iodide of potassium; solution rapidly ensues, which,
  being made up to six ounces, the whole remains perfectly clear; whereas
  the iodide of silver thrown down from 50 grains of nitrate, similarly
  treated with 320 grains of iodide of potassium, and made up to two ounces
  (the proportional quantities), will probably require 10 or 15 grains more
  of iodide to effect perfect solution, the reason being that it contained
  a greater quantity of water <i>pro ratâ</i> than the first.</p>

  <p>The following table, showing the exact quantities of iodide of
  potassium required to decompose 50, 100, and 150 grains of nitrate of
  silver, the resulting weight of iodide of silver, and the weight of
  iodide of potassium to make a clear solution up to 2, 4, and 6 ounces,
  will often be found useful:</p>

  notwithstanding its title, is of still more modern date than the
  so-called castle. I am not aware of any recent historical or descriptive
  work on the county generally. Cæsar Otway, Maxwell, and the <i>Saxon in

  crowd of tourists appear to follow in their track, leaving the far finer

  found cases in considerable number to equal or surpass those which he
  mentions: for instance, in the family of Dundas of Arniston, respecting
  which I find the following note in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, vol.
  lvii. p. 462.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The series is so remarkable, that we subjoin the details:&mdash;Sir
  James Dundas, judge of the Court of Session, 1662; Robert Dundas, son of
  Sir James, judge of the Court of Session from 1689 to 1727; Robert
  Dundas, son of the last, successively Solicitor-General and Lord
  Advocate, M.P. for the county of Edinburgh, judge of the Court of Session
  1737, Lord President 1748, died in 1753 (father of Henry, Viscount
  Melville); Robert Dundas, son of the last, successively Solicitor-General
  and Lord Advocate, and member for the county, Lord President from 1760 to
  1787; Robert Dundas, son of the last, successively Solicitor-General and
  Lord Advocate, Lord Chief Baron from 1801 to 1819; all these judges,
  except the Chief Baron, had been known in Scotland by the title of Lord
  Arniston. They were, we need hardly add, all men of talents, but the two
  Lords President Arniston were of superior eminence in legal and
  constitutional learning."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Hope family, and some other Scottish ones, present as numerous a
  display of legal dignitaries as the above; but the hereditary succession
  from father to son is perhaps not equalled, certainly not excelled, in
  any age or country. In fact, let the opponents of hereditary honours say
  what they will, there is no description of talent except the poetical
  that has not frequently remained in the same family for several
  generations unabated.</p>

  <p><i>Tolling the Bell on leaving Church</i> (Vol. ix., p.
  125.).&mdash;In reply to J.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;M.'s Query, I beg to state that the chief
  reason for tolling the bell while the congregation is leaving church, is
  to <!-- Page 312 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page312"></a>{312}</span>inform the parishioners who have not been
  able to attend in the morning, divine service will be celebrated in the
  afternoon. In scattered villages, or where a single clergyman had to
  perform the duties of more than one church, this was formerly quite
  requisite. At a neighbouring village of Tytherly, the custom is still
  observed, though no longer necessary.</p>

  <p class="author">W. S.</p>

  <p>There is little doubt that priests in olden times were fond of hot
  dinners, and the bell at the conclusion of the service must have been
  intended as a warning to their cooks (and many others) to make ready the
  repast. This is merely a supposition; but I shall cherish the idea in the
  want of a better explanation. The custom has been, until very lately,
  observed in our little country church. There are other customs which are
  still kept up, namely, that of tolling the church bell at eight o'clock
  on Sunday morning, and again at nine, as well as that of ringing a small
  bell when the clergyman enters the reading-desk.</p>

  <p class="author">E. W. J.</p>

  <p class="address">Crawley, Winchester.</p>

  <p>I believe that the custom of tolling the bell when the congregation is
  leaving the church, is to notify that there will be another service in
  the day. This is certainly the reason in this parish (in Leicestershire);
  for after the second service the bell is not tolled, nor if, on any
  account, there is no afternoon service.</p>

  <p class="author">S. S. S.</p>

  <p>When I was Lecturer of St. Andrew's, Enfield, the bells rang out a
  short peculiar peal immediately after Sunday Morning Prayer. I always
  thought it was probably designed to give notice to approaching funeral
  processions that the church service was over, as in the country
  burials&mdash;usually there always on Sundays&mdash;immediately follow
  the celebration of morning service.</p>

  the fourteenth century. The foundation deed of the last was the model in
  founding that of Haccombe."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the same work copies of the foundation deeds of the archipresbytery
  of Haccombe and Beer are printed.</p>

  <p>One would suppose that wherever there was a collegiate body of
  clergymen established for the purposes of the daily and nightly offices
  of the church, as chantry priests, that one of them would be considered
  the superior, or archipresbyter.</p>

  <p>Godolphin, in <i>Rep. Can.</i>, 56., says that by the canon law, he
  that is archipresbyter is also called <i>dean</i>. Query, Would he then
  be other than "Primus inter pares?"</p>

  <p>Prince, in his <i>Worthies</i>, calls the Rector of Haccombe "a kind
  of chorepiscopus;" and in a note refers to Dr. Field <i>Of the
  Church</i>, lib. v. c. 37.</p>

  <p>With regard to the Vicar of Bibury (quoted by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Sansom</span>, "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. ix., p. 185.), he founded his
  exemption from spiritual jurisdiction, I believe, upon his holding a
  <i>Peculiar</i>, and not as an archpriest.</p>

  <p><i>Dogs in Monumental Brasses</i> (Vol. ix., p. 126.).&mdash;I have
  always understood (but I cannot say on any authority) that the dogs at
  the feet of monumental effigies of knights were symbolical of
  <i>fidelity</i>. That signification would certainly be very appropriate
  in monuments of <i>crusaders</i>, where, I believe, they are generally
  found. And I would suggest to <span class="sc">Mr. Alford</span>, that
  the idea might not have been confined to fidelity in keeping the vow of
  the Cross, but might have been extended to other religious vows: in which
  case the ladies undoubtedly might sometimes claim the canine appendage to
  their effigies. The lion might perhaps symbolise <i>courage</i>, in which
  ladies are not commonly supposed to excel.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Those who share the well-grounded opinion of Mr. Petit, that we cannot
  fully enter into the character of English architecture unless we give
  some attention also to French, German, and Italian, will gladly turn to
  the very profusely and handsomely-illustrated volume which he has just
  issued, under the modest title of <i>Architectural Studies in France</i>,
  by the Rev. J.&nbsp;L. Petit, M.A., F.S.A., <i>with Illustrations from
  Drawings</i> by the Author and P.&nbsp;H. Delamotte. It is of course
  impossible, within the limits of our brief notice, to enter into any
  examination of Mr. Petit's views upon the subject of Gothic architecture,
  the principles of which he believes to have been more completely
  developed at an early period in England than anywhere else; and we must
  therefore content ourselves with directing attention to the book itself,
  which will in no small degree supply to the architectural student
  desirous of studying French buildings, the opportunity of doing so; and
  that too under the guidance of one well qualified to direct his steps.
  Mr. Petit has long been known to the antiquarian world as one of our
  greatest authorities on the subject of Gothic architecture; and his
  various papers, illustrated by his own bold yet effective sketches in the
  <i>Archæological Journal</i>, may have prepared some of our readers for a
  volume of great importance; yet we think even they will be surprised at
  the interest and beauty of the present book. Mr. Petit, who has had on
  this occasion the assistance of Mr. Delamotte as a draughtsman, expresses
  his hope that at some future time he may avail himself of that
  gentleman's skill as a photographer.</p>

  <p>There is, perhaps, no man of letters, no man of science, of whom the
  world possesses so unsatisfactory an account as Jerome Cardan. The author
  of <i>Palissy the Potter</i> has therefore done good service, and
  executed a task worthy of himself, by <i>The life of Girolamo Cardano, of
  Milan, Physician</i>. In two small readable volumes, rich in all the
  characteristics of his own peculiar mode of treatment, Mr. Morley has
  given us not only a clear view of the life and character of Cardan, based
  on a diligent and careful examination of his voluminous
  writings&mdash;for Cardan reckoned that he had published one hundred and
  thirty-one books, and left in MS. nearly as many&mdash;but also a
  striking picture of the age in which he lived; and the work, which is one
  of great interest to the general reader, is made still more valuable to
  the literary antiquary by the accuracy with which Mr. Morley quotes his
  authorities.</p>

  <p>Some interesting manuscripts were sold by Messrs. Puttick and Simpson
  on Wednesday, the 22nd ultimo, including original letters by Blake, Penn,
  Monk, Nelson, and other of our most renowned admirals; and of Charles I.
  and Charles II., Oliver and Richard Cromwell, Desborough; and numerous
  autographs of Commonwealth celebrities. The chief lot was a letter from
  Cromwell to Pastor Cotton, in New England, written shortly after the
  battle of Worcester, in which he alludes to the difficulties he has
  experienced in treating with some of the Scotch party. Mr. Carlyle had
  not seen the original, but used the copy among the Arundel MSS. It was
  knocked down to Mr. Stevens, the American agent, for 36<i>l.</i> A
  printed broadsheet of the Peace of Breda sold for 3<i>l.</i> 7<i>s.</i> A
  letter of Richard Cromwell brought 4<i>l.</i> An autograph of Queen Bess
  brought 2<i>l.</i>; and one of Edward VI. brought 2<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i>
  Autographs of Mary are less common: one in this collection realised
  3<i>l.</i> 7<i>s.</i> One of Nelson's letters to Lady Hamilton brought
  2<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i> Altogether, the prices realised were good.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>Lives of The Queens
  of England</i>, by Agnes Strickland, Vol. III. This new volume of the

  Southey's <i>Works and Correspondence of Cowper</i>, which embraces his

  E.&nbsp;J.)</i> to <i>Surtees (Rev. Scott F.)</i>.&mdash;<i>Whitaker's

  modifications, is now confined altogether to Educational Statistics, of
  which it is a most valuable compendium.&mdash;<i>Remains of Pagan
  Saxondom</i>, by J.&nbsp;Y. Ackerman, Parts VIII. and IX. The contents of
  these numbers are:&mdash;Fragments from a Tumulus at Caenby,
  Lincolnshire; Fibula from Ingarsby, Leicestershire; Glass
  Drinking-vessels from Cemeteries in Kent; Fibulæ from Rugby,
  Warwickshire. The great peculiarity of this Series is, that the objects
  are drawn of the size of the originals; thus affording great facilities
  for comparing them with remains of similar character.</p>
